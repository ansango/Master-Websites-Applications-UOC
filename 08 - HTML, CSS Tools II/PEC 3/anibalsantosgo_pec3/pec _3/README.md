# REACT - PARCEL - TAILWINDCSS

## Requirements

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 14.15.x

## Getting started

Clone this repository with `git clone`, or download a .zip file using the top right green button.

Using the Terminal, navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`.

## Features

- Uses [Parcel v2](https://v2.parceljs.org) module bundler.
- NPM scripts for fast development and production build (see Commands below).

### Stylesheets

- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) to CSS compilation.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) features:
  - Transpile modern CSS with [`postcss-preset-env`](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features).
  - Automatically add CSS prefix to unsupported properties with [`autoprefixer`](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).
  - Automatically minify and optimize CSS code on production build with `@parcel/optimizer-cssnano`.

### Scripts

- Allow for modern JavaScript (ES201x/ES8/ES7/ES6â€¦) which is automatically transpiled to ES5 and minifed in production builds, with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

### Images

- Image transformation with [`@parcel/transformer-image`](https://v2.parceljs.org/recipes/image/) (based on [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)). Do not use on this version since it may cause crashes on Netlify deployments.

### Development

- Development server launch and live reloading on file changes.
- Friendly error reporting.

## How to use this boilerplate

Content lives inside the `src/` folder. If you do not want to change the configuration or are unsure about what you are doing, do not edit files outside the `src/` folder.

Always run the following commands during the development stage and for production builds. Please note that it is expected that all projects built with this boilerplate are compiled using `npm run build` before they are published.

### Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Runs a local web server for development and opens the browser to display it. Automatically compiles styles and scripts whenever a file in `src/` is changed, and live reloads the browser. This is what _must be run_ on the development stage.                                                                                                                     |
| `npm run build` | Compiles and minifies and optimizes the files in the assets folder. The generated compiled and optimized files are located in the `dist/` folder. This is what _must be run_ before publishing the project. This is also the build command to be run by external deployment services such as Netlify. The publishable files are then located in the `dist/` folder. |
| `npm run clean` | Deletes the current `/dist` folder and cache folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `npm run test`  | Displays a success message if everything is working as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
