# UOC Master's Degree Documentation & Projects by Course :computer: :books:

The university master's degree in Website and Web Application Development trains professionals specialized in this field, capable of responding to the growing demand for professionals in web development and programming. This master's degree aims to cover the growing professional demand for front-end web developers, with in-depth knowledge of branding and layout, mastery of the tools used in production environments and back-end knowledge.

The Master's curriculum is structured in three main areas: web design fundamentals and layout (HTML and CSS and interface design), web development (JavaScript programming, front-end development and back-end development) and design and development tools.

This is the documentation for the UOC's Master's degree in website and web application development. I have collected all the documentation for each course and each of the projects carried out throughout the Master. You will find practices in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tools, Angular JS, Laravel, Wordpress, Drupal, UI/UX and other examples. The content is arranged according to the subject matter taught by the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Open University of Catalonia, UOC)

## :baby_bottle: Introduction to programming in JavaScript 

In order to level the formative baggage, students without a recommended entrance profile must take 8 credits of formative complements.

The subjects foreseen for this purpose are the following:

Introduction to JavaScript I programming (4 ECTS credits)
Introduction to JavaScript II programming (4 ECTS credits)

## :chocolate_bar: HTML & CSS 

This subject is the basis of the Master's in Web Application Development and the other subjects use it as a basis. It is also offered as an optional subject in the Master's in Application Development for Mobile Devices, in which the combination of HTML and CSS, followed by JavaScript programming, is a very important technology for multiplatform development.

07. Layout

## :pizza: Design of interactive interfaces 

This course deals with interface design and interaction. It is about how the features and functions of a product translate into something that people can use without obstacles, find useful and want to have. Although form and appearance are key, the subject content is not just about the visual interface. Now more than ever, for the user the visual interface is the machine. That's why interface design is so relevant and one of the main activities when developing a web product or application for a mobile device.

### Contents:

01. Fundamentals of Interaction Design and User Experience
02. Interaction: models and typologies
03. Cognitive, social, and emotional aspects of interaction
04. Interfaces
05. Research: data collection, interpretation and presentation
06. Methods and processes of interaction design
07. Identification and collection of requirements
08. Prototyping
09. Evaluation

## :beers: JavaScript programming 

Currently JavaScript is the language used in the Front-end web. Either directly, either through frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, Vue, React or others of the many existing ones, or through super-sets such as TypeScript, in the end programmers use JavaScript to make that part of the web applications that runs in the client's browser.

This course makes an exhaustive review of the most recent version of JavaScript (ECMAScript more specifically) to give people with programming experience the necessary tools to make good Front-end web developments.

### Contents:

01. Introduction to JavaScript. (Basic syntax. Data structures. Functions)
02. Higher-level functions
03. Object-oriented programming
04. Error handling
05. Regular Expressions
06. Modules
07. Asynchronous programming
08. DOM
09. Event handling
10. Canvas
11. HTTP & Forms

## :wine_glass: Frontend Javascript Frameworks 

In software design the front-end is the part of the software that interacts with the users. In web development, we can say that it is the part of the software that runs in the browser. The front-end is in charge of collecting user data, processing them, sending them to the server, receiving the response from the server and showing the results to the user. Although a few years ago there was hardly any programming on the front-end, today the interaction of web applications and the necessary good user experience requires that on the front-end there is a good combination of graphic design, interaction design, information architecture and programming.

### Contents:

01. Introduction to front-end development (ES5)
02. Frontend programming languages (ES6/Typescript)
03. View (BOM/DOM)
04. Frameworks: Introduction to Angular 
05. Angular: Routing 
06. Angular: Working with Template-Driven Forms and Working with Reactive Forms
07. Angular: Services
08. Practice (Compilation of the course)

## :coffee: Backend PHP 

In this subject we will see the fundamentals of this work on the server. To do this, among the multiple solutions that exist, we will see two blocks, all based on the AMP platform (Apache, MySQL, PHP). Ordered from highest to lowest simplicity (and consequently, from lowest to highest power), it is the Drupal content manager, used as if it were an application framework, and Laravel, a PHP application framework that is probably the best alternative to Symfony, the PHP framework on which Drupal works.

## :crown: Master's degree thesis 

In the final master's work, students bring into play and demonstrate the knowledge acquired throughout the master's course. The student will be able to propose a project for the work, which will be reviewed by the faculty to ensure that it is feasible, meets the requirements and that its level of complexity is adequate. In the absence of a project proposal, the faculty will propose a series of projects to be carried out, from which the student will be able to choose the one that best suits their knowledge and preferences.
