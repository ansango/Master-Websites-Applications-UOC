# UOC Master's Degree Documentation & Projects by Course

The university master's degree in Website and Web Application Development trains professionals specialized in this field, capable of responding to the growing demand for professionals in web development and programming. This master's degree aims to cover the growing professional demand for front-end web developers, with in-depth knowledge of branding and layout, mastery of the tools used in production environments and back-end knowledge.

The Master's curriculum is structured in three main areas: web design fundamentals and layout (HTML and CSS and interface design), web development (JavaScript programming, front-end development and back-end development) and design and development tools.

This is the documentation for the UOC's Master's degree in website and web application development. I have collected all the documentation for each course and each of the projects carried out throughout the Master. You will find practices in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tools, Angular JS, Laravel, Wordpress, Drupal, UI/UX and other examples. The content is arranged according to the subject matter taught by the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Open University of Catalonia, UOC)

## 0. Introduction to programming in JavaScript

In order to level the formative baggage, students without a recommended entrance profile must take 8 credits of formative complements.

The subjects foreseen for this purpose are the following:

Introduction to JavaScript I programming (4 ECTS credits)
Introduction to JavaScript II programming (4 ECTS credits)

## 1. HTML & CSS

This subject is the basis of the Master's in Web Application Development and the other subjects use it as a basis. It is also offered as an optional subject in the Master's in Application Development for Mobile Devices, in which the combination of HTML and CSS, followed by JavaScript programming, is a very important technology for multiplatform development.

## 2. Design of interactive interfaces

This course deals with interface design and interaction. It is about how the features and functions of a product translate into something that people can use without obstacles, find useful and want to have. Although form and appearance are key, the subject content is not just about the visual interface. Now more than ever, for the user the visual interface is the machine. That's why interface design is so relevant and one of the main activities when developing a web product or application for a mobile device.

## 3. JavaScript programming

Currently JavaScript is the language used in the Front-end web. Either directly, either through frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, Vue, React or others of the many existing ones, or through super-sets such as TypeScript, in the end programmers use JavaScript to make that part of the web applications that runs in the client's browser.

This course makes an exhaustive review of the most recent version of JavaScript (ECMAScript more specifically) to give people with programming experience the necessary tools to make good Front-end web developments.
